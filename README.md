## Description

This repository contains the exercises and projects I will complete during the Data Analytics & Science master’s program. Here, I will document my findings, methodologies, and results.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`):

```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
jupyter
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AniLP1991/AnalyticsPortfolio.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AnalyticsPortfolio
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate    # On Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To launch your analysis environment or run scripts, use one of the following commands:

```bash
jupyter notebook
# or
python src/main.py --input data/raw/data.csv
```

```

## Analysis Methodology

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   Download data from various sources including CSV files, JSON files, SQL databases, and Snowflake.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   Handle missing values, normalize and encode variables as needed.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   Generate histograms, correlation matrices, and summary statistics to understand data distributions.

4. **Modeling & Validation**  
   Apply machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest) and perform cross-validation to evaluate performance.

5. **Visualization & Reporting**  
   Create dashboards and plots (using libraries like Matplotlib or Plotly) and compile final reports.

## Data

This project uses data from multiple sources:

- **CSV files**: Raw datasets stored under `data/raw/`
- **JSON files**: Configuration or API responses under `data/json/`
- **SQL databases**: Internal or external databases queried via Python scripts
- **Snowflake**: Cloud-based data warehouse connections configured in `src/db/`
